Enhancement: allow to limit snapshots list

`--last` option limit to the very last snapshot for each hosts. In
some case you want to show the n last snapshots. For example if you
want a weekly report of daily snapshots you cannot have this but by
using shell tools and wont report the correct number of snapshots.

Now the `--limit n` allows to list the last n snapshots.
